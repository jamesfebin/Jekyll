By the end of this chapter, you'll have an inventory system that lets your player collect items from the world. Walk near a plant or mushroom, and it disappears into your inventory.

## Building the Pickup System

In Chapter 4, we made solid objects block the player. Now let's do the opposite: make items the player can walk through and collect. 

### The Pickup System

Think about how pickups work in games you've played:

1. **Detection**: "Is the player close enough to this item?"
2. **Collection**: "Remove the item from the world"
3. **Storage**: "Remember what was collected"

We'll build this in three parts:
- A `Pickable` component to mark items as collectible
- A `handle_pickups` system to detect when the player is near items
- An `Inventory` resource to track what's been collected

```d2
direction: down

Player: {
  shape: circle
  label: Player walks near item
}

Detection: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: |md
    - Calculate distance
    - Check if within radius
  |
}

Collection: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: |md
    - Despawn item entity
    - Add to inventory
  |
}

Storage: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: |md
    - Track item counts
    - Display summary
  |
}

Player -> Detection: "Distance check"
Detection -> Collection: "Within radius"
Collection -> Storage: "Update inventory"
```

### Configuring Pickup Radius

Before we build the inventory, let's add configuration for pickup detection. We already have a `config.rs` file from Chapter 4 where we centralized collision settings. Let's add pickup configuration there.

Open `src/config.rs` and you'll see it's organized into modules: `player`, `map`, `debug`. Let's add a `pickup` module:

```rust
// src/config.rs - Add this section after the player module

/// Pickup/inventory configuration
pub mod pickup {
    /// Default radius for item pickup detection (in world units)
    pub const DEFAULT_RADIUS: f32 = 40.0;
}
```

**What's a world unit?**

In Bevy, positions are measured in world units. Our tiles are 32 units wide (from `map::TILE_SIZE`), so a radius of 40 units means the player can pick up items from slightly more than one tile away. Not too far (no vacuuming items from across the map), not too close (no pixel-perfect positioning required).

```comic
left_girl_sad: I set the radius to 1000 and now I'm collecting everything on screen!
right_guy_laugh: Magneto's origin story: one typo away from world domination.
```

## Building the Inventory System

Create a new folder `src/inventory/` for our inventory module.

### Defining Item Types

What kinds of items can the player collect? In our game, we have plants, mushrooms(or something that looks like a mushroom), and tree stumps scattered around the map. Each needs a unique identifier.

Create `src/inventory/inventory.rs`:

```rust
// src/inventory/inventory.rs
use bevy::prelude::*;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::fmt;

use crate::config::pickup::DEFAULT_RADIUS;

/// Types of items that can be collected.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
pub enum ItemKind {
    Plant1,
    Plant2,
    Plant3,
    Plant4,
    TreeStump,
}
```


### Display Names

Players don't want to see "Plant1" in their inventory. They want "Herb" or "Flower". Let's add human-readable names:

```rust
// Append to src/inventory/inventory.rs

impl ItemKind {
    pub fn display_name(&self) -> &'static str {
        match self {
            ItemKind::Plant1 => "Herb",
            ItemKind::Plant2 => "Flower",
            ItemKind::Plant3 => "Mushroom",
            ItemKind::Plant4 => "Fern",
            ItemKind::TreeStump => "Wood",
        }
    }
}

impl fmt::Display for ItemKind {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        f.write_str(self.display_name())
    }
}
```

**What's `fmt::Display` for?**

`fmt::Display`  is like a predefined contract Rust makes with your type. It's like saying, "If you implement this trait, I'll let you use `{}` in print statements."

Without it, `println!("Collected: {}", item_kind)` would fail to compile. Rust wouldn't know how to convert your `ItemKind::Plant1` into text for display. By implementing `Display`, we fulfill the contract, we tell Rust "when you need to print this, call this `fmt` method I wrote."

### The Pickable Component

Now we need a component to mark entities as collectible. When we spawn a plant in the world, we'll attach this component to say "the player can pick this up."

```rust
// Append to src/inventory/inventory.rs

/// Component marking an entity as collectible.
#[derive(Component, Debug)]
pub struct Pickable {
    pub kind: ItemKind,
    pub radius: f32,
}

impl Pickable {
    pub fn new(kind: ItemKind) -> Self {
        Self {
            kind,
            radius: DEFAULT_RADIUS,
        }
    }
}
```

**Why store `radius` per item?**

Most items use the default radius (40 units), but maybe you want a treasure chest to have a smaller radius (must be right next to it) or a glowing orb to have a larger one (magnetic pull). Storing it in the component gives you flexibility.

### The Inventory Resource

The inventory persists across the entire game session, it's not tied to any single entity. That's what Resources are for: global game state that any system can access.

```rust
// Append to src/inventory/inventory.rs

/// Resource storing collected items.
#[derive(Resource, Default, Debug)]
pub struct Inventory {
    items: HashMap<ItemKind, u32>,
}
```

**Why `HashMap<ItemKind, u32>` instead of `Vec<ItemKind>`?**

A `Vec` would store every individual item: `[Plant1, Plant1, Plant2, Plant1...]`. To count how many Plant1s you have, you'd scan the whole list. A `HashMap` stores counts directly: `{Plant1: 3, Plant2: 1}`. It also makes lookups efficient.

### Adding Items

Now let's implement the logic to add items to the inventory:

```rust
// Append to src/inventory/inventory.rs

impl Inventory {
    /// Add an item to the inventory, returns new count.
    pub fn add(&mut self, kind: ItemKind) -> u32 {
        let entry = self.items.entry(kind).or_insert(0);
        *entry += 1;
        *entry
    }

    /// Get a summary string of inventory contents.
    pub fn summary(&self) -> String {
        if self.items.is_empty() {
            return "empty".to_string();
        }

        let mut parts: Vec<String> = self
            .items
            .iter()
            .map(|(kind, count)| format!("{}: {}", kind, count))
            .collect();
        parts.sort();
        parts.join(", ")
    }
}
```

**What's `.entry(kind).or_insert(0)` doing?**

This is HashMap's "get or create" pattern. If `kind` exists in the map, `.entry(kind)` gets a mutable reference to its value. If not, `.or_insert(0)` creates it with a count of 0. Then we increment and return the new count.

**Why return the count from `add`?**

So the pickup system can log "Picked up Herb (total: 3)". It's a small quality-of-life feature that makes debugging easier.

**What's the `summary` method for?**

It formats the inventory for display: "Herb: 3, Flower: 1, Wood: 2". We sort the items alphabetically so the order is consistent. Later, you could show this in a UI panel or debug overlay.

```comic
left_guy_smile: I collected 50 herbs but forgot to save before the boss fight.
right_girl_laugh: Speedrunning heartbreak, I see.
```

## Pickup Detection System

Now for the system that actually detects when the player is near an item. Create `src/inventory/systems.rs`:

```rust
// src/inventory/systems.rs
use bevy::prelude::*;

use crate::characters::input::Player;
use super::inventory::{Pickable, Inventory};

/// System that checks for and processes item pickups.
pub fn handle_pickups(
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut inventory: ResMut<Inventory>,
    player_query: Query<&Transform, With<Player>>,
    pickables: Query<(Entity, &GlobalTransform, &Pickable)>,
) {
    let Ok(player_transform) = player_query.single() else {
        return;
    };

    let player_pos = player_transform.translation.truncate();
    let mut collected = Vec::new();

    // Check distance to each pickable
    for (entity, global_transform, pickable) in pickables.iter() {
        let item_pos = global_transform.translation().truncate();
        let distance_sq = player_pos.distance_squared(item_pos);
        
        if distance_sq <= pickable.radius * pickable.radius {
            collected.push((entity, pickable.kind));
        }
    }

    // Process collected items
    for (entity, kind) in collected {
        commands.entity(entity).despawn();
        let count = inventory.add(kind);
        info!(
            "📦 Picked up {} (total: {}) — inventory: {}",
            kind, count, inventory.summary()
        );
    }
}
```

Let's break this down step by step.

### Getting the Player Position

We query for the player's `Transform` (filtered by `With<Player>`). `.single()` returns `Result` because there might be zero or multiple players. If it fails, we exit early.

**What's `.truncate()`?**

`Transform.translation` is a `Vec3` (x, y, z). We're in 2D, so we only care about x and y. `.truncate()` converts `Vec3` to `Vec2`, dropping the z component.

### Collecting Items to Process

Before we can despawn collected items, we need to identify which ones are within pickup range. Here's how we do it:

```rust
let mut collected = Vec::new();

// Check distance to each pickable
for (entity, global_transform, pickable) in pickables.iter() {
    let item_pos = global_transform.translation().truncate();
    let distance_sq = player_pos.distance_squared(item_pos);
    
    if distance_sq <= pickable.radius * pickable.radius {
        collected.push((entity, pickable.kind));
    }
}
```

We create an empty `Vec` and iterate through all pickable items. For each item within range, we store its entity ID and item kind as a tuple `(entity, pickable.kind)`. This gives us a list of everything the player just picked up.

**Why `distance_squared` instead of `distance`?**

The actual distance formula is `sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²)`. Square root is expensive. But we're just comparing distances, so we can compare the *squared* distances instead:

- `distance < radius` is the same as `distance² < radius²`
- No square root needed, just multiplication

This is a common game dev optimization. When checking hundreds of items every frame, it adds up.


### Processing Collected Items

For each collected item:
1. **Despawn the entity**: Removes it from the world (no more rendering, no more queries)
2. **Add to inventory**: Updates the count in the HashMap
3. **Log the pickup**: Prints to console for debugging


**Why collect items into a `Vec` first before despawning them?**

Remember in Chapter 1 when we learned about `mut`? That was just the beginning. Rust has more rules about how you can access and modify data, enforced by something called the **borrow checker**.

**Why does Rust need a borrow checker?**

Let's start with a fundamental problem: when should we free memory? When you create a variable in most languages, it allocates memory. When you're done with it, that memory should be freed:

```d2
direction: right

Create: Create variable\n(allocate) {
  shape: rectangle
}

Use: Use variable {
  shape: rectangle
}

Free: Free variable\n(cleanup) {
  shape: rectangle
}

Create -> Use -> Free
```

**Languages like Python and JavaScript: Garbage Collection**

In Python or JavaScript, you never explicitly free variables. A *garbage collector* runs periodically, checking which variables are still being used:

```d2
direction: down

Program: Your Program Running {
  shape: rectangle
}

Pause: Pause Program {
  shape: rectangle
}

Scan: Scan All Variables {
  shape: rectangle
}

Identify: Find Unused Ones {
  shape: rectangle
}

Free: Free Their Memory {
  shape: rectangle
}

Resume: Resume Program {
  shape: rectangle
}

Program -> Pause -> Scan -> Identify -> Free -> Resume -> Program
```

This is convenient, you don't think about memory. But it has costs:
- **Pause times**: The garbage collector must pause your program to scan memory
- **Overhead**: It tracks every variable at runtime, using extra memory
- **Unpredictability**: You don't know when pauses happen 

**Rust's Approach: Compile-Time Checks**

Rust takes a different approach. It checks at compile time that your code follows strict rules. When the compiler sees these rules followed, it knows *exactly* when each variable's memory can be freed, no runtime tracking needed:

```rust
// Pseudo code, don't use
fn example() {
    let items = vec![1, 2, 3];  // items owns the vector
    
    process(items);              // ownership transferred to process()
                                 // items can't be used anymore
}  // Compiler inserts cleanup here - no garbage collector!
```

The borrow checker enforces rules that let the compiler figure out memory lifetimes. Let's learn these rules.

**The Borrowing Rules**

**Many readers OR one writer, never both**

You can have many immutable references OR one mutable reference, but not both at the same time.

*Why?* Imagine you're reading a map while someone is erasing and redrawing it. You might read half-old, half-new data—corruption! This rule prevents that:

```d2
direction: down

Safe: Safe (many readers) {
  shape: rectangle
  
  Read1: Read {
    shape: rectangle
  }
  
  Read2: Read {
    shape: rectangle
  }
  
  Variable: Variable {
    shape: rectangle
  }
  
  Read1 -> Variable
  Read2 -> Variable
}

Unsafe: Unsafe (reader + writer) {
  shape: rectangle
  
  Read: Read {
    shape: rectangle
  }
  
  Write: Write {
    shape: rectangle
  }
  
  Corrupted: Corrupted! {
    shape: rectangle
  }
  
  Read -> Corrupted
  Write -> Corrupted
}
```

Example code:

```rust
// Pseudo code, don't use
let mut inventory = vec!["Herb", "Flower"];

let reader1 = &inventory;  // ✓ Immutable borrow
let reader2 = &inventory;  // ✓ Another immutable borrow is fine
println!("{:?}", reader1); // Both can read
println!("{:?}", reader2);

// After the immutable borrows are done being used, we can create a mutable borrow:
let writer = &mut inventory;  // ✓ Now this works
writer.push("Mushroom");
```

The key insight: borrows end when they're last used, not when they go out of scope. Once `reader1` and `reader2` are done (after the `println!` calls), the mutable borrow is allowed.

This won't compile:

```rust
// Pseudo code, don't use
let mut inventory = vec!["Herb", "Flower"];

let reader = &inventory;
let writer = &mut inventory;  // ✗ ERROR: Can't borrow as mutable while immutably borrowed

println!("{:?}", reader);  // reader still used here
```

**References must always be valid (no dangling pointers)**

A reference can't outlive the data it points to.

*Why?* In C++, you can create a pointer to memory that gets freed, leaving a "dangling pointer." Reading it accesses random memory—crash or worse, subtle corruption.

Here's a C++ example that compiles but crashes at runtime:

```cpp
int* create_dangling_pointer() {
    int x = 5;           // x is allocated on the stack
    int* ptr = &x;       // ptr points to x
    return ptr;          // Return pointer to x
}  // x goes out of scope here - memory freed!

int main() {
    int* ptr = create_dangling_pointer();
    
    // ptr now points to freed memory (dangling pointer)
    std::cout << *ptr;   // CRASH! Reading freed memory
    
    return 0;
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Function creates local variable `x` on the stack
2. Function returns a pointer to `x`
3. When function exits, `x` is destroyed, but `ptr` still holds its address
4. Back in `main`, using `ptr` reads memory that's been freed
5. Result: undefined behavior (crash, garbage data, or worse)

Rust prevents this at compile time:

```rust
// Pseudo code, don't use
fn dangling() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s  // ✗ ERROR: `s` doesn't live long enough
}  // s is dropped here, but we're trying to return a reference to it!
```

The compiler rejects this. You must either return the owned value or ensure the reference outlives the data.

**How this helps with memory management:**

When Rust sees code following these rules, it can prove at compile time that:
- No variable is used after being freed 
- No variable is modified while being read 
- Memory can be safely freed when the owner goes out of scope

The compiler inserts cleanup code automatically, knowing it's safe. No garbage collector needed!

**How this applies to our code:**

When we write `for (entity, global_transform, pickable) in pickables.iter()`, we're borrowing the entity storage *immutably* to read through it. But `commands.entity(entity).despawn()` needs to *mutably* borrow that same storage to remove entities.

If we tried to do both at once:

```rust
// Pseudo code, don't use
// This WON'T compile!
for (entity, _, _) in pickables.iter() {  // ← Immutable borrow starts here
    commands.entity(entity).despawn();     // ← ERROR: Trying to mutably borrow!
}
```

Rust would reject this with: *"cannot borrow as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable."*

Why? Imagine if it worked: while you're iterating (reading) the list of entities, you're also removing entities from that same list. The iterator might try to read an entity that was just deleted, causing a crash.

**The solution: collect-then-process**

```rust
// Pseudo code, don't use
let mut collected = Vec::new();

// Step 1: Immutable borrow - just reading
for (entity, global_transform, pickable) in pickables.iter() {
    collected.push((entity, pickable.kind));  // Copying entity IDs
}  // ← Immutable borrow ends here

// Step 2: Mutable borrow - now we can modify
for (entity, kind) in collected {
    commands.entity(entity).despawn();  // ✓ Safe! No conflicting borrows
}
```

We finish reading before we start writing. The borrow checker is satisfied, and we avoid potential crashes.

## Wiring It Together

Create `src/inventory/mod.rs` to expose the inventory system as a plugin:

```rust
// src/inventory/mod.rs
use bevy::prelude::*;

use crate::state::GameState;

mod inventory;
mod systems;

pub use inventory::{ItemKind, Pickable, Inventory};
use systems::handle_pickups;

/// Plugin for inventory and pickup functionality.
pub struct InventoryPlugin;

impl Plugin for InventoryPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.init_resource::<Inventory>()
            .add_systems(
                Update,
                handle_pickups.run_if(in_state(GameState::Playing)),
            );
    }
}
```

**What does `.init_resource::<Inventory>()` do?**

It creates the `Inventory` resource by calling `Default::default()` (which creates an empty HashMap) and registers it with Bevy. Now any system can access it with `Res<Inventory>` or `ResMut<Inventory>`.

### Integrating the Plugin

Open `src/main.rs` and add the inventory module and plugin:

```rust
// src/main.rs - Add to module declarations
mod inventory;
```

Then add the plugin to your app:

```rust
// src/main.rs - Add to the plugin chain
.add_plugins(state::StatePlugin)
.add_plugins(characters::CharactersPlugin)
.add_plugins(inventory::InventoryPlugin)  // Add this line
.add_plugins(collision::CollisionPlugin)
```

## Making Items Pickable

Now we have the infrastructure, but no items to pick up! Our procedural map generation system needs to know which decorative objects should be pickable.

### Updating the Asset Spawner

Open `src/map/assets.rs`. We'll add a method to the `SpawnableAsset` struct that marks an asset as pickable:

```rust
// src/map/assets.rs - Add this method to the impl block for SpawnableAsset

// Inside impl SpawnableAsset {

/// Make this asset a pickable item.
pub fn with_pickable(mut self, kind: ItemKind) -> Self {
    self.pickable = Some(kind);
    self
}
```

This method lets us chain `.with_pickable(ItemKind::Plant1)` when defining spawnable assets.

Next, update the `SpawnableAsset` struct to store the pickable item kind:

```rust
// src/map/assets.rs - Add this field to SpawnableAsset struct

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct SpawnableAsset {
    sprite_name: &'static str,
    grid_offset: GridDelta,
    offset: Vec3,
    tile_type: Option<TileType>,
    pickable: Option<ItemKind>,  // Add this line
}
```

Update the constructor to initialize this field:

```rust
// src/map/assets.rs - Update the new() method

impl SpawnableAsset {
    pub fn new(sprite_name: &'static str) -> Self {
        Self {
            sprite_name,
            grid_offset: GridDelta::new(0, 0, 0),
            offset: Vec3::ZERO,
            tile_type: None,
            pickable: None,  // Add this line
        }
    }
    // ... rest of the methods

```

### Making the Spawner Attach Components

Now update the spawner function to actually attach `Pickable` components when entities are created. Find the `create_spawner` function in `assets.rs` and add cases for pickable items:

```rust
// src/map/assets.rs - Update create_spawner function to handle pickables

// Inside fn create_spawner(...) -> ... {
// Inside  match (tile_type, pickable) {
        // Pickable plants with grass tile type
        (Some(TileType::Grass), Some(ItemKind::Plant1)) => |e: &mut EntityCommands| {
            e.insert((TileMarker::new(TileType::Grass), Pickable::new(ItemKind::Plant1)));
        },
        (Some(TileType::Grass), Some(ItemKind::Plant2)) => |e: &mut EntityCommands| {
            e.insert((TileMarker::new(TileType::Grass), Pickable::new(ItemKind::Plant2)));
        },
        (Some(TileType::Grass), Some(ItemKind::Plant3)) => |e: &mut EntityCommands| {
            e.insert((TileMarker::new(TileType::Grass), Pickable::new(ItemKind::Plant3)));
        },
        (Some(TileType::Grass), Some(ItemKind::Plant4)) => |e: &mut EntityCommands| {
            e.insert((TileMarker::new(TileType::Grass), Pickable::new(ItemKind::Plant4)));
        },
        
        // Pickable tree stump
        (None, Some(ItemKind::TreeStump)) => |e: &mut EntityCommands| {
            e.insert(Pickable::new(ItemKind::TreeStump));
        },
        
        // ... existing cases for non-pickable tiles
        

```

### Marking Props as Pickable

Finally, open `src/map/rules.rs` and find the `build_props_layer` function. This is where decorative objects like plants and stumps are defined. Add `.with_pickable()` to make them collectible:

```rust
// src/map/rules.rs - Update the plants section in build_props_layer

// Plants - make them all pickable
terrain_model_builder.create_model(
    plant_prop.clone(), 
    vec![SpawnableAsset::new("plant_1")
        .with_tile_type(TileType::Grass)
        .with_pickable(ItemKind::Plant1)  // Add this line
    ]
);
terrain_model_builder.create_model(

```

**What's happening here?**

We're using the builder pattern to configure each spawnable asset. `.with_tile_type(TileType::Grass)` says "this is grass for collision purposes," and `.with_pickable(ItemKind::Plant1)` says "the player can collect this as a Plant1 item."

Not all tree stumps are pickable—only `tree_stump_2` gets the `.with_pickable()` call. This adds variety to the world: some stumps are just decorative obstacles, others are harvestable resources.

## Testing the Inventory

Run your game:

```bash
cargo run
```

Walk near a plant or mushroom. It should disappear, and you'll see a log message:

```
📦 Picked up Herb (total: 1) — inventory: Herb: 1
📦 Picked up Flower (total: 1) — inventory: Flower: 1, Herb: 1
📦 Picked up Herb (total: 2) — inventory: Flower: 1, Herb: 2
```

left_girl_smile: I spent 3 hours collecting herbs instead of doing the main quest.
right_guy_laugh: Ah yes, professional procrastination. A true gamer's specialty.
```

## What's Next?

You've built a working inventory system! But it's invisible—players can't see what they've collected. In Chapter 6, we'll build a UI overlay that displays the inventory on screen, add item icons, and create a crafting system that combines items into new ones.

For now, experiment with your pickup system:
- Try changing `DEFAULT_RADIUS` in `config.rs` to make pickups easier or harder
- Add new `ItemKind` variants for different collectibles
- Modify the `summary` format to show items in a different order
